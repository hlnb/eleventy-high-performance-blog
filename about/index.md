I was born in a little mining town called Kalgoorlie and raised in the sun-kissed city of Perth, Western Australia. From a young age, I was fascinated by technology - my father could turn washing machine parts and other odds and ends into a makeshift rocket! That early exposure to tinkering and innovation sparked a lifelong passion for discovery and exploration.

After high school, I made the bold decision to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force. The military was a challenging but transformative experience. I honed my technical skills, but more importantly, I developed an unshakable resilience and problem-solving mindset that would serve me well in the years to come.

Leaving the RAAF, I transitioned into education, sharing my love of technology as a mentor and instructor at the Central Institute of Technology. Watching eager students grasp the intricacies of web design and development was incredibly rewarding. I took great pride in shaping the next generation of tech enthusiasts.

But my own journey was far from over. I felt a calling to do more, to apply my unique blend of military discipline, educational expertise, and technological acumen in a new way. And so, I founded Graphite Edge, a digital consultancy dedicated to helping small and medium businesses navigate the ever-evolving online landscape.

Through it all, my personal story has been one of continuous growth and self-discovery. The challenges of military life and the demands of the tech world have tested me, but they've also made me stronger, more adaptable, and more committed to lifelong learning.

Today, I stand as a testament to the power of resilience, reinvention, and the transformative potential of technology. My path has been anything but ordinary, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I invite you to join me as I continue to explore, inspire, and empower in the digital frontier and beyond.
